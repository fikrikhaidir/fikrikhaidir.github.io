#### Lots of love, it's me, Fikri

Welcome to my blog. Where all of you will be bedazzled by my ridiculously explained tutorials, absurd opinions about tech, and maybe i'll write some life stories and advice too. We'll never know, since it is my first post. About me...
What do you need to know about me ?

Well, i'm just a regular man who fell in love with **Computer, Natural Sciences, and Philosophy**. Currently i'm working at Geekgarden as a Project Manager. I write **Python** very well, which then helps me develop a better web apps via **Django**. I know Python the first time when i was a middle-schooler. i had nothing better to do than goofing around as a "Script Kiddies", being a blackhat wannabe, defacing websites and some activities related to that. Back then i'm just a script kiddies capable of building a single website with HTML and Native **CSS**. But then i developed a taste for **javascript**. Although it did not last long, it still gives me the thrill of creating something i wanted. Being a man in charge, being a man with power to create anything from a notepad++ (how nostalgic it is to just think about that).

Years have passed, now i'm a **Project Manager** working at Geekgarden Yogyakarta **Full Stack Web Developer**, **AI Researcher**, and **Game Programmer**. I had some  experience teaching undergrad to Develop a video game using **Unity** and **Construct 2** back when i was working at my university. At the same time, i was recruited to be a member of a research team on **AI** development. At that time, we developed **expert system** to predict some things, and **fuzzy logic system** for scholarship applicants filtering system which i develop to be one of my publications. Later on, i fell in love with the simplicity of **Django** which then become my main weapon at arsenal. I did freelance works mostly with **Django** and **Python**.
